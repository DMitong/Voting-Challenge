# Token Smart Contract

## Background

The smart contract in this repository is part of a 15 day smart contract building challenge. The challenge has three levels of difficulty, namely:

- Basic: The challenges from Day 1 to Day 5
- Intermediate: The challenges from Day 6 to Day 10
- Advanced: The challenges from Day 11 to Day 15

## Challenge Task: Basic 3

Write a smart contract that can implement a simple voting system. The contract should have an array that stores the candidatesâ€™ names. The contract should also have a mapping that stores the votes for each candidate. The contract should also have a function to allow voters to cast their votes, only once per address. The contract should also have a function to declare the winner, based on the highest number of votes.
