// Challenge: This is part of a 15 day smart contract writing challenge, with 5 days for each level of difficulty, basic, intermediate and advanced.

/*
Basic 3: 
Write a smart contract that can implement a simple voting system.
The contract should have an array that stores the candidatesâ€™ names. 
The contract should also have a mapping that stores the votes for each candidate.
The contract should also have a function to allow voters to cast their votes, only once per address.
The contract should also have a function to declare the winner, based on the highest number of votes.
